# Api-request-in-Javascript-using-Axios
axios:-is basicaly a promise based http client which works in both node.js environment and browser and used for making http request
I did an API request for getting a data from a link http://saral.navgurukul.org/api/courses
 
first of all in this project you have to create a directory and then open that directory in terminal
then type the following command 

npm init

it will create a node modules folder and package.json file in your directory
then install axios  by the following command

npm install axios -save
npm install fs

*fs is a file_system module which will help you to work with the file that are there in your system

-save will create a dependeny of the respected module imported so that it is easier to run the same code in anothers system and your friend will not have to install all the modules again.

now create a file with  .js extension whiich will be your main file where you will write a code for making an Api request
